Haidee's Poem

There was once a girl called Haidee,
Her brain was feeling quite lazy,
So she began to code,
kick started learning mode,
and now she's using it daily!

She started with html,
and believed it was going quite swell,
So she added some css to pretty the mess,
And dabbled with javascript as well!
