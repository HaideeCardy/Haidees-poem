Haidee's Poem

There was once a girl called Haidee,
her brain was feeling quite lazy,
so she began to code,
kick-started learning mode,
and now she's using it daily!

She started with html,
and believed it was going quite swell,
so she added some css,
to pretty the mess,
and dabbled with javascript as well!

Next up was GitHub,
the tech version of a pub..?
it was a bit of a challenge,
but she thinks she can manage,
let's hope it doesn't end up a dud!
